                <div class="review"><p>So you're walking around taking in the sites, or just relaxing at Central Park. You may even be there for business, when the worst happens. You need to find a bathroom. Fortunately for you, some of the nicest public bathrooms available are in the Time Warner Center, which overlooks Columbus Circle. While the bathrooms are a bit out to the way, which only insures that you'll have privacy. The effort to get to the bathroom is worth it. They are always clean, and the stalls always lock. The center is mainly a mall so you can shop before you continue about your business. The bathroom is great but the location means it gets 4 PLY!</p></div>

                <div class="review"><p>The David Rubenstein Atrium at Lincoln Center is located at 62nd street between Broadway and Columbus Avenue. Its a great location for a bathroom if you cant make the Time Warner Center or any of the bathrooms in Central Park, most of which are a long walk. The bathrooms are free and spotless. The atrium itself also has free Wi-Fi available which as a bonus can be used in the bathroom. There is another group of bathrooms located on the concourse level under the Metropolitan Opera House. Both sets of bathrooms also are wheelchair accessible which makes them even more convenient. This one gets a 5 PLY!</p></div>
