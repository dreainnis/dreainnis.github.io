                    <p>The bathroom at Trader Joes is tucked away in the back corner of the store. 
                    You have to be desperate to find this hidden treasure, but when you do, you will not regret it. 
                    There is an ample supply of toilet paper that flows freely from the roll. 
                    The floor, sink and toilet are all sparkling like they were freshly cleaned. 
                    I always prefer not to sit, but would recommend if you need to. 
                    This deserves a 5 ply rating for the additional features of seat covers and the option of dryers or paper.</p>

                <p>This bathroom visit is a trek all the way up on the 6th floor. 
                It requires a code, but no fear; it was open when I arrived. 
                You can also wait outside or seek out an associate. 
                After all the trouble, this was not worth the wait. 
                The toilet paper came up short every time and required a few tugs to get an ample amount. 
                2 out of 4 toilets seemed to be clogged and the ones that seemed operational, looked a bit scary. 
                The pump did contain soup but nothing to dry my hands with. 2 ply rating all around for this loo. </p>
